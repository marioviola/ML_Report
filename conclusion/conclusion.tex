As a conclusion, during this lab we have realized the difficulty to work with real-world data especially in the case of the regression. With our dataset, the clustering algorithms seems to be less efficient than the GMM and SVM to perform classification. Moreover, regression was difficult to do with our dataset because of the complexity of our dataset (many points have the same x-axis value).
