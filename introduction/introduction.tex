\section{Introduction}

%This template is only here to guide you when writing the report. Feel free to amend this template as you wish. When reporting on your work do not explain the techniques you are using. You do not have space for this. Focus on reporting only on the results you get when you apply these techniques. Do not forget that the report is 10 pages long maximum (single column, 10pt minimum) in PDF format. {\bf Pages beyond the tenth one will be ignored and material in these pages will not be graded.}

The purpose of this assignment is to apply different Machine Learning algorithms, seen during the lecture, on real-world data. Throughout this report, we explore the influence of hyper parameters of each algorithm. This work aims to have a better understanding on how to deal with these hyper parameters in order to obtain better score and performance. The overall algorithms are performed on \texttt{MLDEMOS} software.
