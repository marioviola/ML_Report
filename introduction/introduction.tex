\section{Introduction}

%This template is only here to guide you when writing the report. Feel free to amend this template as you wish. When reporting on your work do not explain the techniques you are using. You do not have space for this. Focus on reporting only on the results you get when you apply these techniques. Do not forget that the report is 10 pages long maximum (single column, 10pt minimum) in PDF format. {\bf Pages beyond the tenth one will be ignored and material in these pages will not be graded.}
